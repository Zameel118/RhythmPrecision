# RhythmPrecision

## Description

RhythmPrecision is an interactive command-line tool designed to test and improve a user's sense of rhythm and timing. The application challenges users to maintain a consistent rhythm by pressing a key at regular intervals, providing immediate feedback on their performance.

## Features

- **Customizable Difficulty Levels**: Choose between three different rhythm speeds (1, 2, or 3 seconds) to match your skill level
- **Adjustable Session Length**: Set your practice sessions from 5 to 50 rounds based on your availability and endurance
- **Real-time Feedback**: Receive immediate "Great!", "Okay!", or "Miss!" ratings after each attempt
- **Comprehensive Performance Analysis**: Review detailed metrics including:
  - Fastest, average, and slowest response times
  - Round-by-round breakdown with timing differences
  - Early/late indicators to help adjust your timing

## How It Works

RhythmPrecision measures the time intervals between your key presses and compares them to your target rhythm. The application calculates the percentage difference between your actual timing and the target, then rates your performance accordingly:
- ≤8% difference: "Great!"
- ≤16% difference: "Okay!"
- >16% difference: "Miss!"

## Use Cases

- Musicians developing a stronger internal sense of timing
- Gamers improving reaction time consistency
- Anyone looking to enhance their rhythmic coordination and timing precision
- Educational tool for teaching concepts of rhythm and consistent timing

## Future Development

- Additional difficulty modes
- Visual rhythm representation
- Sound feedback options
- Performance tracking over time
